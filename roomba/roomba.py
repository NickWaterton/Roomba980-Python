Python 2.7/Python 3.5/3.6 (thanks to pschmitt for adding Python 3 compatibility)
Program to connect to Roomba 980 vacuum cleaner, dcode json, and forward to mqtt
server

Nick Waterton 24th April 2017: V 1.0: Initial Release
Nick Waterton 4th July   2017  V 1.1.1: Fixed MQTT protocol version, and map
paths, fixed paho-mqtt tls changes
Nick Waterton 5th July   2017  V 1.1.2: Minor fixes, CV version 3 .2 support
Nick Waterton 7th July   2017  V1.2.0: Added -o option "roomOutline" allows
enabling/disabling of room outline drawing, added auto creation of css/html files
Nick Waterton 11th July  2017  V1.2.1: Quick (untested) fix for room outlines

    This is a Class for Roomba 900 series WiFi connected Vacuum cleaners
    Requires firmware version 2.0 and above (not V1.0). Tested with Roomba 980
    username (blid) and password are required, and can be found using the
    password() class above (or can be auto discovered)
    Most of the underlying info was obtained from here:
    https://github.com/koalazak/dorita980 many thanks!
    The values received from the Roomba as stored in a dictionay called
    master_state, and can be accessed at any time, the contents are live, and
    will build with time after connection.
    This is not needed if the forward to mqtt option is used, as the events will
    be decoded and published on the designated mqtt client topic.
